## My Challenge Format

For each project, I will attempt not look at the source code of the `*-FINISHED.html` or the explanation video to make a working prototype. If I am absolutely stuck, I can look at the finished source but denote within my own prototype where I `cheated`. I will then commit and push with a git message similar to `01 prototype`.

After I am satisified with the prototype I will watch the video and/or source code to see where I could improve on each. After making some improvements, I will then commit and push with a git message similar to `01 completed`.

## Secondary Goals
