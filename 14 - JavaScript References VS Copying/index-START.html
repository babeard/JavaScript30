    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    const players2 = players

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    players2[0] = 'Brian'

    // now here is the problem!
    console.log(players, players2)

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const players3 = players.slice()
    players3[0] = 'Chris'
    console.log(players, players3)

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const players4 = [].concat(players)
    players4[0] = 'Chris'
    console.log(players, players4)

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const players5 = [...players]
    
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    players5[0] = 'Chris'
    console.log(players, players5)

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const person2 = person
    person2.name = 'Brian Beard'
    console.log(person, person2)

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const person3 = Object.assign({}, person)
    person3.name = 'Chris Topper'
    console.log(person, person3)

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
